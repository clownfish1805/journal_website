          <h2>Plagiarism Policy</h2>
          <p>
            In accordance with the University Grants Commission (UGC)
            Regulations on Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers
            and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures
            for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education, 2018, The
            International Journal of Academic Excellence (IJAE) adheres to
            strict plagiarism guidelines to ensure the integrity of academic
            publications. Our plagiarism policy follows the guidelines of the
            UGC’s Promotion of Academic Integrity and Prevention of Plagiarism
            in Higher Educational Institutions Regulations, 2018.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features of the IJAE Plagiarism Policy:</h3>
          <h4>Definition of Plagiarism</h4>
          <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as using another person's work, ideas, or
            expressions without appropriate credit or acknowledgement, and
            presenting it as one’s own. This includes all forms of academic
            publications, such as research articles, books, theses, and
            dissertations.
          </p>

          <h4>Similarity Index</h4>
          <p>
            All submitted manuscripts should be checked for similarity using
            reputable plagiarism detection software. The similarity index should
            be included in the manuscript and adhere to the limits specified
            below.
          </p>

          <h4>Acceptable Level of Similarity</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For research articles, the acceptable similarity index is up to
              10%.
            </li>
            <li>
              For review articles and other publication types, a similarity
              index of up to 15% is permissible.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is recommended to review the complete UGC Plagiarism Policy for
            any updates.
          </p>

          <h4>Consequences of Plagiarism</h4>
          <p>
            If plagiarism is detected, the manuscript will be rejected, and
            authors will be notified of the decision. In cases of confirmed
            plagiarism, authors may be prohibited from submitting future
            manuscripts to IJAE.
          </p>

          <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
          <p>
            IJAE upholds the ethical standards outlined by the UGC to prevent
            academic misconduct. All cases of academic dishonesty, including
            plagiarism, will be addressed according to these standards to ensure
            fair and ethical publishing practices.
          </p>

          <h4>Self-Plagiarism</h4>
          <p>
            Authors should submit only original manuscripts. Submissions
            previously published in full or in part are not allowed, and
            manuscripts must not be under review by another journal.
          </p>
